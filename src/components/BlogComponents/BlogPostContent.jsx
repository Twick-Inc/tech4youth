            Our Commitment to Technology Education
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Youth Tech is a non-governmental organization dedicated to fostering a comprehensive understanding of technology and innovation within the Tanzanian community. Given the significant number of Tanzanians with limited education in information communication and technology, Youth Tech is committed to ensuring that the country's youth, particularly children and women, are well-informed and educated in areas such as development, cybersecurity, website design, artificial intelligence, and programming.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            Why Technology Education Matters
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We believe that technology is a powerful catalyst for social and economic development, especially in addressing urgent challenges like climate change, healthcare access, and education quality. By equipping our youth with essential ICT skills, we're not just preparing them for jobsâ€”we're empowering them to create innovative solutions for Tanzania's future challenges.
